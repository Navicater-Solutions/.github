# Welcome to the Navicater GitHub Profile Repository ðŸš€

This repository showcases Navicater's GitHub profile and features!

The `.github` directory is where we can store templates for issues, pull requests, workflows, and community guidelines across all your repositories. ðŸ’¡

If a repository doesnâ€™t have its own `.github` folder, it will use the templates from this special `.github` repo. Simple and efficient! ðŸŽ¯
